	Builds a shared library that can be imported in Python
	to access the C++ implementation of this Canny3D.
	
	I wrote this Canny3D implementation in C++ so that it is
	as fast as possible (faster than if it were written in Python).
	
	The rest of the module is in Python.
	
	If you're working on this module, you probably won't need
	to modify any of the C++ code, unless you want to improve
	the algorithm somehow (like for speed/optimization).
